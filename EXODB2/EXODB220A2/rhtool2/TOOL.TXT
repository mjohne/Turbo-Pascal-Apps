OVERVIEW

TV Tool Box copyright (c) 1992,93 Richard W. Hansen
All rights reserved.

The TV Tool Box library was created to enhance the Turbo Vision framework
for Turbo Pascal. TV Tool Box includes formatted data entry with input masks,
scrolling data entry dialogs, versatile control for data entry field
locking, check mark menus, enhancements to TApplication, string routines, 3D
controls, 3D tool bars, iconizable windows, popup menus, virtual list boxes,
slider controls, spin controls, and more.

TV Tool Box is distributed as Shareware, IT IS NOT FREE. If you use TV Tool
Box, please register it. Your registration will allow me to create future
versions of this product. TV Tool Box is a work in progress, it is by no
means complete. What happens in the future versions is up to you. If you have
any ideas for new TV extensions please let me know and I will try to include
them. Future versions will be available to registered users for a nominal
fee.


DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before buying it.
If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are expected to
register. With registration, you will get printed documentation, a copy of
the latest version with readable source and a disk of bonus utilities, source
code, and programs.

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and the
copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions as stated
below. Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just like commercial
authors, and the programs are of comparable quality. (In both cases, there
are good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy and distribute
the software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group. For example,
some authors require written permission before a commercial disk vendor may
copy their Shareware.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You should find
software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's commercial or
Shareware. The Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because you
can try before you buy. And because the overhead is low, prices are low also.
Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
product, you don't pay for it.

LICENSE AGREEMENT

TV TOOL BOX is a "Shareware package" and is provided at no charge to the user
for evaluation. Feel free to share, but please do not give it away altered or
as part of another package. If you find this program useful and find that you
are using TV TOOL BOX and continue to use TV TOOL BOX after a reasonable
trial period, you must make a registration payment of $40.00 to Richard
Hansen. The $40.00 registration fee will license one copy for use on any one
computer at any one time, site licenses are available by contacting Richard
Hansen. You must treat this software just like a book. Each licensed copy may
be used by only one person at a time, just as a book cannot be read by two
different persons at the same time.

Anyone distributing TV TOOL BOX for any kind of remuneration must first
contact Richard Hansen for authorization.

DEMO

The file Demo.exe is the main demo for TV Tool Box. This demo shows most of
the features of TV Tool Box. Choose the [Test] option off the main menu bar
to check them out. Select [Data Entry] to test some new data entry
features. TV Tool Box supports formatted data entry using programmer supplied
entry mask strings. You can include literals, such as '(' or '-' in your
masks, that cannot be typed over by your users. The data entry features also
include, field locking, hidden password fields, justification, trimming, and
alternate padding chars.

If you ever wanted a little fancier look in your TV apps (dare I say it),
like Visual Basic for DOS, check out the 3D controls. The 3D controls include
a vertical or horizontal tool bar (almost like MS Windows?), 3D buttons
that can have up to two lines of text, 3D input lines, 3D list boxes, 3D
history lists, etc.

Select [Check Marks] and try out the check mark enhancement for menus.

If you have need of a ASCII/HEX editor, like those used in disk utilities,
now you have got one. Select [Ascii/Hex Editor] to check it out.

Have you ever wanted a simple way to display some text without creating a
dialog box or window and a specialized Draw method, try the [Text Display
Window] option. This will display a TbxTextWindow object. With TbxTextWindow
you just create it and use the Write method to display string, almost like
writing to the screen without Turbo Vision.

If you select [Message Dialog], you can check out a replacement for the
MessageBox procedure. A TbxMessageDialog will automatically size itself for
the number and length of the lines of text you insert into it.

On the [Setup] menu, you can setup a neat idea I stole from my favorite
programmer's text editor "Multi-Edit" from American Cybernetics, Inc. If you
check the option, the mouse cursor will be turned off whenever the keyboard
is used. The mouse cursor is restored whenever the mouse is moved or a mouse
button is pressed.

Included in TV Tool Box is a descendant of TDialog called TbxRunDialog. A
TbxRunDialog is used to create progress display dialogs for things like
printing, copying files, etc. TbxRunDialog has easy an method for
implementing pause, continue, and cancel. There are two ready made
descendants of TbxRunDialog, TbxPercentDialog and TbxPrintDialog.
TbxPercentDialog displays the percentage completion with a progress bar.
TbxPrintDialog is a skeleton for a printing dialog. Select [Progress Dialog]
or [Print Dialog] to try them out.

[Virtual List Boxes] provide a list box that is perfect for database work or
whenever you have a list that is too large a normal TCollection. Virtual
list boxes display a only a portion of a larger (perhaps very much larger)
list. Virtual list boxes can page through the list or jump to the beginning
or end of the list. The demo implements a list of all integers from 1 -
99999. This is obviously too large for a TCollection which can handle a
maximum of 16K elements.

I have added a couple enhancements to TWindows. A TbxWindow can be minimized,
using the "minimize" icon in the upper right corner. If you hit Alt-Minus,
or press the right mouse button on the "close" icon, a window control menu
will popup.

Please be sure and check out the file Scroll.exe for a look at scrolling
dialogs and data entry windows.


GETTING STARTED

TV Tool Box is broken into several units. The unit names and their contents
generally correspond with the associated Turbo Vision units :

TVDEFS.INC     Some defs that change the compilation.
TVCONST.PAS    Global constants.
TVTYPE.PAS     Global types.
TVSTRING.PAS   String handling routines.
TVINPUT.PAS    Extensions of TInputLine and other data entry objects.
TVVIEWS.PAS    Extensions of TView and other objects defined in Views.pas.
TVDIALOG.PAS   Extensions of TDialog and other objects defined in Dialogs.pas.
TVAPP.PAS      Extensions of TApplication from App.pas.
TVMENUS.PAS    Extension of menu objects in Menus.pas.
TVSCROLL.PAS   Scrolling dialog boxes and data entry windows.
TV3D.PAS       3D dialog boxes and control objects.

Just copy the source code into your working directory or one that is
identified in "unit paths" of your compiler configuration. The first time you
compile, make sure to do a "build" or "make" so the needed TPUs will be
created. If you compile "Demo.pas" and "Scroll.pas", all the TPUs will be
created.

All objects and types defined by TV Tool Box begin with the prefix "Tbx" all
object pointer types begin with the prefix "Pbx". This will allow you to
easily identify a TV Tool Box type and should avoid problems with like named
objects in other libraries. This naming convention is changed from version
1.0 and may cause you some minor conversion problems. The intent was to
provide some standardization and a base to build on in future versions. I
apologize if this causes undue difficulties, but it seemed the best method to
bring a little order to the library.

TV Tool Box is supplied in source code form, to avoid compilation problems.
Don't bother trying to read it though, it has been pretty well mangled and is
very hard to read. THE FULL READACLE SOURCE CODE IS INCLUDED WITH THE
REGISTERED VERSION.

When compiling you should use the X+, B+, and V- compiler directives. These
directives are set as the default in all the TV Tool Box units.

This documentation should have a familiar look, as I tried to copy the
Borland style as much as possible (without going nuts). One difference is
that each object entry title lists the parent object, if any, in parentheses
immediately following the object name, i.e.  Tbx3DButton (TButton).

Function        Convert Date to a string, following the formatting
                instructions in Picture. Picture must be a string like
                "mm/dd/yy", "DD/MM/YYYY", etc. The characters "d", "D", "m",
                "M", "y", "Y" or "/" are the only characters used in
                formatting the output.

                "d" or "D" specifies the position of the day, "m" or "M"
                specifies the position of the month, and "y" or "Y" specifies
                the position of  the year in the output. Day, Month, and Year
                may be separated by a forward slash, "/". Days and months
                would normally be two characters, years may be up to four
                characters. Any "/" characters in the mask will be replaced
                by the character in the DateSlash constant.

                Unused day, month, or year characters in Picture will be
                replaced by spaces or zeros in the output. If a format
                character is upper case it is replaced by a space. If a
                format character is lower case it is replaced by zero.

                                 DP : Integer): String;
Function        Returns a formatted string from floating point number Flt
                according to the formatting instructions contained in Mask
                and the maximum number of decimal places in DP. DP specifies
                the number of digits to the right of the decimal place to
                retain in the output. If DP is negative, the number of the
                digits is determined strictly by the output mask. DP can be
                used to align numbers with different decimals on the decimal
                point. Note : The maximum mask size is 30 characters.

                The three characters #,@,& indicate how to format the output
                string. They serve as place holders in the mask for the
                digits in the number. All other characters are copied from
                the mask to the output unchanged.

                In the output any unused # is replaced by a space, any unused
                @ is replaced by zero, and any unused & is deleted. The #,@,&
                characters can be mixed as desired in the mask. Given the
                same mask, calls to FormatF with different values of DP will
                return strings with the decimal points aligned.

                If a number is too large to fit in the given mask, all digits
                in the output will be set to '*'.

                Accepts all characters 1 through 255, except Tab, for entry.
                When a valid character is typed it saves the character in the
                data buffer and broadcasts three messages: cmUpdateView,
                cmEditView, and kbRight.  These messages inform peer views to
                redraw, inform the parent to update the maximum edit
                position, and the cursor to move to the next character.

TbxAsciiHexEditor (TbxWindow)                                   TvViews
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                The TbxAsciiHexEditor object implements a ASCII/HEX editing
                window. It is just like those used with many disk utility
                programs. The window can be of any size, but to keep ASCII
                and Hex views in sync, in side by side views, there are a
                couple things to remember. The hex view will take twice as
                many chars to display the data as the ascii view. So the X
                dimension should be an even number that will allow one view
                to be exactly twice as big as the other. The X dimension
                should also be evenly divisible by 3. This will make sure
                that the hex display does not split a character across two
                rows. This said, make sure to account for the frame.

                An example : a width of 62, allows 3 chars for the frame, and
                will give hex view 40 wide and an ascii view 20 wide.

                Because of all the above, and because the right combination
                of gfGrow modes could not be found, the window is set up to
                only grow in the Y axis.

Fields 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

LView           LView : PbxEditBuff;

                Pointer to the hex editor view on the left side.

RView           RView : PbxEditBuff;

                Pointer to the ascii editor view on the right side.

VScrollBar      VScrollBar : PbxMultiScrollBar;

                Pointer to a vertical scroll bar.

Indicator 	Indicator : PbxPosIndicator;

                Points to a view that displays the current cursor byte
                position the data buffer.

Modified	Modified : Boolean;

                Indicates if any characters in the data have been changed
                since the window was created.

                                 Buff: Pointer; BuffSize: Word);

                Creates and inserts a hex editor and an ascii editor. The hex
                editor is sized to be exactly twice as wide as the ascii
                editor. Bounds.B.X is adjusted as needed to get the correct
                overall width for the window. The AOptions param in Init only
                uses the ofPosIndicator flag. ofPosIndicator tells the window
                whether or not to insert a position indicator into the frame.
                ATitle and ANumber are passed through to TWindow.Init.

Load            Constructor Load(var S: TStream);

                Constructs the object from stream S by calling TWindow.Load,
                then reading the new data belonging to TbxAsciiHexEditor.
                The data buffer is not loaded from the stream. You must make
                a call to the SetData method to establish the data buffer and
                buffer size.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxCheckBoxes are here so all data entry objects can have
                field locking and error checking. All other functionality is
                identical to the normal check box.

Fields 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
ID              ID : Word;

                Currently assigned id number. Id numbers are assigned
                automatically by TbxEntryDialog.Insert. Id numbers must be
                unique.

LLabel          LLabel : PLabel;

                Pointer to the label associated with the check boxes.

EditFlags	EditFlags : Word;

                Holds the dfXXX flags used to control editing and formatting
                options. Only the dfRequired flag has any effect on check
                boxes.

Methods 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Init            Constructor Init(var Bounds: TRect; AStrings: PSItem);
                Creates a set of check boxes with the given bounds by calling
                TCheckBoxes.Init. Sets the ID and EditFlags to zero, and
                LLabel to nil. Sets the EventMask to include broadcast
                events.

Load            Constructor Load(var S: TStream);
AddLabel	Procedure AddLabel(ALabel: PLabel);

                Associates a label with the control. All labels should be
                attached to their corresponding controls so that when the
                control is locked the label can be locked too. Label text
                will be used to construct the default error messages.

Empty           Function Empty: Boolean; Virtual;

                Returns True if no boxes are checked. Empty is used when
                validating a required field.

GetID           Function GetID: Word;

                Returns the ID number assigned to the object. ID numbers are
                used by TbxEntryDialog to locate a specific control in the
                dialog box and return a pointer to it.

                ID numbers are useful for dialogs stored on streams. Field ID
                numbers will remain constant when the dialog is loaded from a
                stream, where as any pointers to the object will change.

GetFieldName    Function GetFieldName: String; Virtual;

                Used to get the field name displayed with error messages. By
                default it returns the text in the label pointed to by
                LLabel. If LLabel is nil a null string is returned.

HandleEvent	Procedure HandleEvent(var Event: TEvent); Virtual;

                Calls the inherited HandleEvent then processes any cmSetId or
                cmIdentify commands. cmSetId commands are issued by
                TbxEntryDialog to set the ID of an object. CmIdentify
                commands cause the object to return a pointer to itself.

Lock            Procedure Lock;

                Locks the field and label by setting sfDisabled in the State
                flags.

SetEditFlag	Procedure SetEditFlag(AFlag: Word; Enable: Boolean);

                Sets the EditFlags for the check box. Only the dfRequired
                flag has any effect on check boxes.

SetID           Procedure SetID(AFieldID: Word);

                Sets ID to AFieldID.

SetState	Procedure SetState(AState: Word; Enable: Boolean); Virtual;

                Calls the inherited SetState, then, if AState contains
                sfDisabled, calls the LLabel^.SetState with sfDisabled and
                the value in the Enable parameter.

Store           Procedure Store(var S: TStream);
UnLock          Procedure UnLock;

                Unlocks the field and label by clearing sfDisabled in the
                State flags.

Valid           Function Valid(Command: Word): Boolean; Virtual;

                If the field is required and the Empty method returns True,
                Valid generates a cmFieldError event and returns False. If
                the field is not required Valid returns the value received
                from the inherited Valid function.

TbxCheckListBox (TbxListBox)                                    TvDialog
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxCheckListBox is a list box that allows selection of
                multiple items in a list. List items are proceeded by a "[ ]"
                or "[X]", depending on their "Selected" state. If a list
                contains 256 or fewer items, you may use the SetSelectSet and
                GetSelectSet methods to select a set of items or get a set of
                all the selected items.  Alternately, you may use SelectItem
                and IsSelected to set or check the "Selected" state of a
                single item. Remember that collections are numbered starting
                from zero.  TbxCheckListBox is derived from TbxListBox so its
                collection must be a TbxCollection of TbxObjects (or
                descendants). You can't override GetText and use a string
                collection because the collection items need a Boolean
                "Selected" field.

Methods 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
GetSelectSet	Procedure GetSelectSet(var ASet: TbxByteSet);

                If there are 256 or fewer items in the list, GetSelectSet is
                the easiest way to find the selected items. Each item that is
                selected in the list box will have a corresponding item
                returned in ASet. Collection items are indexed from zero.

GetText         Function GetText(Item: Integer;
                                 MaxLen: Integer): String; Virtual;

                Builds the lines for the list box. Takes the text returned by
                the item's GetText method and appends a '[X]" or "[ ]"
                depending on the value return by the item's GetSelect method.

HandleEvent	Procedure HandleEvent(var Event: TEvent); Virtual;

                Checks for mouse presses in the list and toggles the
                "selected" state of the item under the mouse cursor.

IsSelected	Function IsSelected(Item: Integer): Boolean; Virtual;

                Returns the "selected" state of the item at the position
                of Item in the list box.

SelectItem	Procedure SelectItem(Item: Integer); Virtual;

                Sets the "selected" state of the item at position Item in the
                list to True. Redraws the list box.

SetSelectSet	Procedure SetSelectSet(ASet: TbxByteSet);

                When the size of the list is 256 or less, you can use
                SetSelectSet to set multiple items in the list to "selected".
                For example the set [1..3, 10, 20] will check the items 2 to
                4 and items 11 and 21 in the list. Remember that collections
                are numbered from zero.

DateString	Function DateString(Picture: TbxDateSt): TbxDateSt;

                Returns the date as string based on the format in Picture.
                The characters 'D', 'd',  'M', 'm', 'Y', and 'y' detail the
                positions of day, month, and year in the date string. Any '/'
                characters are replaced by the character in the global
                constant DateSlash. Any unused uppercase format characters
                are replaced by spaces, and unused lowercase format
                characters are replaced by zeros.  The day, month, and year
                specifiers can appear in any position in the picture.

                The picture "MM/DD/YY" might return a date such as " 4/
                4/93", while the picture "mm/dd/yy" would return a string
                like "04/04/93". The strings "MMDDYY" and "mm/dd/yyyy" would
                return " 4 493" and "04/04/1993" respectively.

Valid           Function Valid(Command : Word): Boolean; Virtual;

                Uses DatePic to extract the day, month, and year from the
                string input. If dfDefaults flag in EditFlags is True, Valid
                will fill in any missing data with the default values from
                DefautlDay, DefaultMonth, or DefaultYear. After any default
                data is filled, the date is validated.

                If the date is not valid, Valid will generate a cmFieldError
                event. The InfoPtr field of the event will contain a pointer
                to an error message for display.

TbxEditBuff (TScroller)                                         TvViews
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxEditBuff is an editable TScroller. It is the base object
                for the hex and ascii edit buffers used with the
                TbxEditBuffWindow.

Fields 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Buf             Buf : PbxByteArray;

                Pointer to raw data buffer supplied to the object.

BufSize         BufSize : Word;

                Size of the memory block pointed to by Buf,

ItemSize	ItemSize : Byte;

                The display size of each character in the buffer.

Methods 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Init            Constructor Init(Bounds: TRect; Buff: Pointer;
                                 BuffSize: Word; ItemWidth: Byte;
                                 AVScrollBar: PScrollBar);
                After calling the inherited constructor, Init turns on the
                ofFramed bit in Options and displays a block cursor. Buff is
                a pointer to the data being edited. BuffSize is the size of
                Buff. ItemWidth is the display width of each character.
                ItemWidth is used to calculate the number of rows in the
                display and the physical offset in the buffer. An ascii
                display would have an item width of one, while a hexadecimal
                display would have an item width of two per character.

Load            Constructor Load(var S: TStream);

                Loads the object from stream S. The buffer pointer is set to
                nil and the buffer size is set to zero. The buffer and buffer
                size must be set by calling SetData.

DataSize	Function DataSize: Word; Virtual;

                Returns the size of a TbxBufData record.

GetData         Procedure GetData(var Rec); Virtual;

                Returns a pointer to the buffer and buffer size in a
                TbxBufData record.

GetOffset	Function GetOffset: Word;

                Returns the position of the cursor in the buffer.

GetXY           Procedure GetXY(var Pos: TPoint);

                Returns the X,Y coordinates of the cursor in the view. GetXY
                returns the logical X,Y based on the item size.

HandleEvent	Procedure HandleEvent(var Event: TEvent); Virtual;

                Mainly handles cursor movement in the view. Actual editing is
                left to descendant views to process. Processes page up, page
                down, arrow keys, ctrl-page up, ctrl-page down, mouse presses
                and scroll bar messages

SetData         Procedure SetData(var Rec);Virtual;

                Set the data buffer pointer and data buffer size. Expects Rec
                to be a TbxBufData record.  Calculates the maximum number of
                display rows. Resets the view positioning to the top of the
                buffer.

SetXY           Procedure SetXY(Pos: TPoint);

                Sets the position of the cursor in the view. Pos is the
                logical position and will be translated to the physical
                position by multiplying X by ItemWidth.

Store           Procedure Store(var S: TStream);

                Write the object to a stream. The data buffer is not saved.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                This is the base input line for all the new data entry
                objects. When you pass an edit mask MaxLen is calculated
                automatically.  Only the characters in the set associated
                with a particular edit mask character will be accepted as
                valid input. You may mix different mask characters in the
                edit mask. An edit mask may contain literal characters that
                cannot be edited.  Literals allow you to create inputlines
                for entering information like dates and phone numbers.

Fields 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
PadChar         PadChar : Char;

                This is the character displayed at all editable positions in
                the input line. It defaults to a space.

XPos            XPos : Byte;

                Next character insert position in the data.

First           First : Byte;

                First editable position (non-literal mask character) in the
                line.

Mask            Mask : PString;

                A pointer to the edit mask for the input line. The user
                entered data and the edit mask are stored in separate
                strings.

ID              ID : Word;

                A unique ID number for the input line. ID numbers are
                assigned by automatically by TbxEntryDialog.Insert.

LLabel          LLabel : PLabel;

                Pointer to the label attached to the input line.

EditFlags	EditFlags : Word;

                A combination of the various dfXXXX flags such as dfRequired,
                dfHide that control special editing capabilities.

Methods 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Init            Constructor Init(var Bounds: TRect; const AMask : String);

                Calculates the number of actual editable characters in AMask
                then calls TInputLine.Init. AMask controls many of the
                features of a TbxEditLine, because it supplies the editing
                mask for the object.

                At each position in the edit mask, only those characters in
                the valid set associated with a particular edit mask
                character will be accepted as input. You may mix different
                mask characters in the edit mask. AMask may contain literal
                characters that cannot be edited. Literals allow you to
                create input liness for entering information like dates and
                phone numbers. As an example, "$9999.99" would be a good
                mask for dollar amounts. The mask "(999) 999-9999 ext 999"
                would allow for full phone numbers with extension.

                The valid mask characters are listed below

                Character       Function
                X               Any character.
                U               Any character, force upper case
                L               Any character, force lower case
                a               Alpha numeric only
                u               Alpha numeric only, force upper case
                l               Alpha numeric only, force lower case
                #               Numbers, minus
                9               Numbers only
                &               Hexadecimal numbers
                @               Dates  (internal use only)

Load            Constructor Load(var S: TStream);
Done            Destructor Done; Virtual;

                Disposes of the edit mask string, then calls the inherited
                Done.

AddLabel	Procedure AddLabel(ALabel : PLabel);

                Associates a label with the input line. When a label is
                added, its text will be used to construct the default error
                messages. If the input line is locked (disabled) any
                associated label will also be locked.

DataSize	Function DataSize: Word; Virtual;

                Returns the size of the edit mask string, which is the size
                of the data string returned by GetData.

Draw            Procedure Draw; Virtual;

                Merges the user entered data string with the edit mask and
                displays the result.

EditToMaskPos	Function EditToMaskPos(Pos : Integer): Integer;

                Converts a position in the edit mask to a position in the
                data string.

Empty           Function Empty: Boolean; Virtual;

                Returns True if the input line is empty. By default it
                returns True if the input data string is null.

GetData         Procedure GetData(var Rec); Virtual;

                Merges the input data string with the edit mask, replacing
                any unused edit mask characters with PadChar, and returns the
                result.

GetFieldName	Procedure GetFieldName: String; Virtual;

                Returns the name to display in any error messages. By default
                GetFieldName returns the text in the label attached to the
                input line.

GetID           Function GetID: Word;

                Returns the ID assigned to the input line. If the input line
                is inserted into a TbxEntryDialog unique ID numbers will be
                assigned automatically. When using a TbxEntryDialog, ID
                numbers can be used to get a pointer to the input line.

                ID numbers are useful for dialogs stored on streams. ID
                numbers will remain constant when the dialog is loaded from a
                stream, where as any pointers to the input line will change.

HandleEvent	Procedure HandleEvent(var Event: TEvent); Virtual;

                HandleEvent is the most complex method of a TbxInputLine. It
                has all the standard functionality of a normal TInputLine,
                including scrolling and block marking. But it also processes
                the input events according to the edit mask.

                Each time a key is pressed the current edit mask character is
                checked. Only those characters in the valid entry set
                associated with the current mask character are allowed as
                valid entry. In addition, HandleEvent skips over an non-mask
                literal characters in the edit mask.

HomePos         Function HomePos: Integer; Virtual;

                Returns the home position of the cursor. The cursor moves to
                this position in the line when a kbHome event is processed by
                HandleEvent.

InsertChar	Procedure InsertChar(Ch: Char); Virtual;

                Inserts Ch into the line at the current cursor position.

MaskToEditPos	Function MaskToEditPos(Pos : Integer): Integer;

                Converts a position in the input data to a position in the
                edit mask.

Lock            Procedure Lock;

                Disables the input line and label.

Merge           Procedure Merge(var St: String; Justify: Boolean); Virtual;

                Merges the input data into the edit mask. Pads the data as
                needed with PadChar to fill the edit mask. If Justify is
                True, the line will be right or left justified as indicated
                by the edit flags.

NextPos         Function NextPos(Pos: Integer): Integer; Virtual;

                Returns the position of the next editable character in the
                edit mask.

PrevPos         Function PrevPos(Pos: Integer): Integer; Virtual;

                Returns the position of the first preceding editable
                character in the edit mask.

Remove          Function Remove(const St: String): String;

                Extracts the data string from the a merged data and edit mask
                strings.

SetData         Procedure SetData(var Rec); Virtual;

                Set the data for the input line. Expects the data to be the
                same as returned by GetData. This means the string is merged
                with the edit mask, so that the literal characters are
                included, and it is exactly as it will appear when displayed
                in the input line on screen.

SetEditFlag	Procedure SetEditFlag(AFlag: Word; Enable: Boolean); Virtual;

                Sets the bits in the EditFlag field. Works like the SetState
                procedure expects it toggles bits in EditFlag.

SetID           Procedure SetID(AFieldID: Word);

                Sets ID to AFieldID.

SetState	Procedure SetState(AState: Word; Enable: Boolean);  Virtual;

                Sets the State flag for the input line. If AState contains
                the flag sfDisabled, the sfDisabled flag of the label is also
                set .

Store           Procedure Store(var S: TStream);
UnLock          Procedure UnLock;

                Unlocks the input line and label.

Valid           Function Valid(Command : Word): Boolean; Virtual;

                If the dfRequired flag is set, the input line is checked to
                make sure it is not empty. If it is empty the field name is
                acquired by calling GetFieldName. An error message with the
                field name is created and inserted into the InfoPtr field of
                a cmFieldError event that is sent to the owner view.

                Any dialogs that have a TbxEditLine or descendant inserted
                into them should be able to respond to cmFieldError broadcast
                events. Valid will insert a pointer to the error message in
                the InfoPtr field of the TEvent record of the cmFieldError
                event. TbxEntryDialog type displays any error messages by
                calling the MessageBox function in STDDLG.PAS.

TbxFileDialog (TFileDialog)                                     TvDialog
                TbxFileDialog is a new file list dialog that implements a
                look that is much closer to the Microsoft Windows file
                dialog. It displays directories and drives in a separate
                window from the files list. TbxFileDialog also has a display
                line that shows the statistics for the current file. Any file
                that is opened with a double click in the file list will be
                added to the file history box, unlike the normal TFileDialog.

                TbxFloatEdit is the base object for all floating point input
                lines. Both the floating point types objects (Double, Real)
                vary only in the range of numbers that are valid and the data
                types returned and expected by SetData and GetData.

Init            Constructor Init(var Bounds: TRect; const AMask: String);

                Initializes the input line. The maximum edit size of the
                field is calculated automatically from AMask. AMask should
                contain only the characters '#' or '9' for mask characters.
                The '9' allows the digits 0 through 9, while the '#' also
                allows a minus sign to be entered. Literal characters may be
                included in AMask, to create edit masks such as "$9999.999".

                A decimal point may only be entered if one is included in
                AMask. Only as many digits as specified in the edit mask may
                be entered to the right of the decimal point. If a decimal
                point exists, TbxFloatEdit accepts numbers with or without a
                decimal point.

                TbxLinkedBox is a a list box that can be linked to a
                TbxLinkedLine object. Each time the focus in the list
                changes, the information displayed in the input line changes.

                The list box will generate an event using the link command
                assigned with the constructor of each object. The event will
                include a pointer to the focused item in the InfoPtr field.
                The TbxLinkedLine will handle the event and extract the data
                it needs from the focused item and update its display.

                Init is the same as TListBox.Init except for the EventCode
                parameter. EventCode should be the same one assigned to the
                TbxLinkedLine associated with this list box. EventCode is
                assigned to LinkEvent and is used to hook the two controls
                together. EventCode must be unique for each paired
                TbxLinkedBox and TbxLinkedLine.If the code is not unique
                other TbxLinkedLines will also interact with the list box.

                is stored in the InfoPtr field of the TEvent. The dialog box
                should have a TbxLinkedLine that responds to the LinkEvent.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxLinkedLine is linked to a TbxLinkedBox.It is just like an
                ordinary input line, except that it updates its contents
                whenever the focus of the list box changes.

                To link to a list box, you assign a unique command id to the
                input line and list box. Each list box and input line pair
                must be assigned a unique command. The list box will generate
                events using the command id. The InfoPtr field of the event
                will hold a pointer to the list box data item. The default
                HandleEvent expects the Event.InfoPtr to be a PString, this
                is the default for standard list boxes.

TbxListBox (TListBox)                                           TvDialog
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxListBox is a list box that processes a TbxCollection of
                TbxObjects. TbxListBox gets the text to be displayed from the
                TbxObject.GetText method. This means that one list box can
                handle any type of list, as long as that list is a collection
                is of TbxObjects.

                If you have a list box that displays data from non-string
                objects, you need to create new a TObject type. With the
                standard list box you also need to create a new TListBox type
                and override the GetText method. If you use TbxListBox you
                will not have to create a new TObject and override GetText,
                since TbxListBox.GetText already knows how to get the text
                from any TbxObject in a TbxCollection.

Methods 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
GetText         Function GetText(Item: Integer;
                                 MaxLen: Integer): String; Virtual;

                Calls the GetText method for the Itemth object in the list
                and returns  the string.

TbxLongEdit (TbxNumeric)                                        TvInput
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxLongEdit is the base object for all integer edit lines.
                AMin and AMax define the valid range of values for the field.
                If AMin and AMax are both zero any number may be entered. All
                the other integer objects vary only in the range of numbers
                that are valid and the data type used by SetData and GetData.

Fields 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Min             Min : LongInt;

                                 AMin: LongInt; AMax: LongInt);

                The maximum edit size of the field is calculated
                automatically from AMask. AMask defines a picture that
                controls what characters may be entered. AMask can contain
                literal charaters as well as number digit place holders. Two
                characters can be used for indicating digits, '#' and '9'.
                The '9' allows the digits 0 through 9, while the '#' also
                allows a minus sign to be entered.

TbxMenuBar (TMenuBar)                                           TvMenus
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxMenuBar provides a descendant of TMenuBar that can display
                check marked menu items. To use check mark menu items create
                a TbxMenuBar instead of the normal TMenuBar and insert into
                the menu bar as normal. Just replace the standard NewItem,
                with a call to the function NewMarkedItem. Call ToggleMarker,
                SetMarker, ClearMarker, and MarkerIsSet, to manipulate and
                check for marked items. Use ResetMarkers handle a set of
                check mark menu items

Methods 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

                Clears the check mark from the menu item with the command Cmd.

FindCmd         Function FindCmd(AMenu: PMenu; Cmd: Word): PMenuItem;

                Returns a pointer to the menu item with the command matching
                Cmd.This can be used to find any menu item, check mark or
                not.

HandleEvent	Procedure HandleEvent(var E : TEvent);      Virtual;

                HandleEvent will automatically toggle a checked menu item on
                or off as needed (if the menu command is cmMarkStart through
                cmMarkEnd). However, this is only useful when multiple items
                can be checked at the same time. If only one item in a set
                can be checked at a time, you should use the ResetMarkers
                procedure to put the menu in the correct state.

MarkerIsSet	Function MarkerIsSet(Cmd : Word): Boolean;

                Returns True if the menu item assigned to Cmd is checked.

ResetMarkers    Procedure ResetMarkers(FirstCmd: Word; LastCmd: Word;
                                       NewCmd: Word);

                ResetMarkers is used to manipulate a logical set of check
                mark menu items. First, all menu items from FirstCmd through
                LastCmd are unchecked. Then the menu item assigned to NewCmd
                is checked.

SetMarker	Procedure SetMarker(Cmd: Word);

                Sets the check mark for the menu item that matches Cmd.

ToggleMarker	Procedure ToggleMarker(Cmd: Word);

TbxMessageDialog (TDialog)                                      TvDialog
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxMessageDialog is an easier way to display messages in a
                dialog. TbxMessageDialog takes the same parameters as the
                standard MessageBox function for displaying a title and
                buttons. It does not handle the '^M' formatting parameters.
                However, you can add multiple strings through multiple calls
                to AddMessage. The dialog will size itself based on the text
                to be displayed. There is also checking in the X axis to make
                sure the strings are not too long.

Fields 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

                Calls TDialog.Init with a dummy bounds rect and a title based
                on the contents of the AOptions parameter. AOptions is stored
                in the DOptions field. The dialog bounds does not need to be
                supplied, since it is calculated before the dialog box is
                executed. The AOptions flag also supplies the information on
                buttons to be added. Use the mfXXXX constants in the
                MSGBOX.PAS unit supplied with Turbo Vision to set the value
                of AOptions.

AddMessage	Procedure AddMessage(St: String);

                Adds St to the end of the list of strings to display in the
                dialog box. AddMessage can be called as many times as needed
                to add dialog text.

Execute         Function Execute: Word; Virtual;

                Execute is normally called only by TProgram.ExecuteDialog. It

OutOfRange	Function OutOfRange: Boolean; Virtual;

                This method is called by Valid to check if the number is in
                the valid range. OutOfRange returns True if the number is out
                of the valid range. By default TbxNumeric.OutOfRange returns
                False. Descendant objects should override OutOfRange.

OutOfRangeMsg	Function OutOfRangeMsg: String; Virtual;

                Returns an error message to be displayed for out of range
                errors.

TbxObject (TObject)                                             TvObjects
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxObject is used with many list box objects in TV Tool Box.
                It has a method that returns a string for display in a list
                box. By using descendants of TbxObject one list box object
                can handle any type of collection of TbxObjects (or
                descendants). It is easier to add a GetText method to a new
                object, which you most likely needed to create anyway, than
                create a new list box type.

                This is intended as an abstract object only. It should never
                be instantiated directly, only derived objects should
                actually be created.

Methods 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
GetText         Function GetText(MaxLen: Integer): String; Virtual;

                This method should return a string of MaxLen. The string will

                used in pairs. Items selected in one list box are deleted and
                inserted into the other list box. This list box expects a
                TbxCollection of TbxObjects, but this can be changed by
                overriding the default GetText method.

Methods 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
HandleEvent	Procedure HandleEvent(var Event: TEvent); Virtual;

                Processes double mouse presses and cmTakeItem commands. 
                Double mouse presses behave like the space bar to 
                select items. Selected items are deleted and inserted 
                into the other list box.

                If a cmTakeItem command is received, HandleEvent 
                inserts the object pointed to by the InfoPtr field of 
                the event record into its collection.

SelectItem	Procedure SelectItem(Item: Integer); Virtual;

                Deletes the item at Item in the collection and sends a
                cmTakeItem message to the other list box in the pair. The
                cmTakeItem message informs the other list box, to insert the
                passed object into its collection. A pointer to the object is
                passed in the InfoPtr field of the TEvent record.

                TbxPercentDialog is a descendant of TbxRunDialog used for
                displaying percent done and a progress bar during long
                processing sequences. As your processing is being done, a
                call to Increment or IncrementBy will change the percent
                complete and update the progress bar.  You must define a
                Process method to do whatever actual work is needed.

                100.

Count           Count : LongInt;

                Current completion count, used with Total to calculate the
                percent complete.

Step            Step : Word;

                The amount to increment Count by at each step.

Pct             Pct : PStaticText;

                initial value of a changeable message that can be display in
                the first line of the dialog box. If you pass a message
                string, you must set AOptions to include mfMessageLine.

                AStep is the size to increase the completion counter by at
                each step in processing and ATotal is the maximum (or
                completed) size of the counter.

                TbxRadioButtons are here so all data entry objects can have
                field locking and error checking. All other functionality is
                identical to the normal radio buttons.

Fields 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
ID              ID : Word;

                Currently assigned id number. Id numbers are assigned
                automatically by TbxEntryDialog.Insert. Id numbers must be
                unique.

LLabel          LLabel : PLabel;

                Pointer to the label associated with the radio buttons.

EditFlags	EditFlags : Word;

                Holds the dfXXX flags used to control editing and formatting
                options. Currently there are no edit flags that affect radio
                buttons.

Methods 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Init            Constructor Init(var Bounds: TRect; AStrings: PSItem);

                Creates a set of radio buttons with the given bounds by
                calling TRadioButtons.Init. Sets the ID and EditFlags to
                zero, LLabel to nil. Sets the EventMask to include broadcast
                events.

Load            Constructor Load(var S: TStream);
AddLabel	Procedure AddLabel(ALabel: PLabel);

                Attaches a label to the radio buttons. Labels should be
                attached to their corresponding controls so that when the
                control is locked the label can also be locked. Label text
                will be used to construct the default error messages.

GetId           Function GetID: Word;

                Returns the ID number assigned to the radio buttons. ID
                numbers are used by TbxEntryDialog to locate a specific
                control in the dialog box and return a pointer to it.

                ID numbers are useful for dialogs stored on streams. ID
                numbers will remain constant when the dialog is loaded from a
                stream, where as any pointers to the object will change.

GetFieldName    Function GetFieldName: String; Virtual;

                Used to get the field name displayed with error messages
                generated by the Valid method. By default it returns the text
                in the label pointed to by LLabel.

HandleEvent	Procedure HandleEvent(var Event: TEvent); Virtual;

                Calls the inherited HandleEvent then processes any cmSetId or
                cmIdentify commands. cmSetId commands are issued by
                TbxEntryDialog to set the ID of the field. CmIdentify
                commands cause the object to return a pointer to itself.

Lock            Procedure Lock;

                Locks the field and label by setting sfDisabled in the State
                flag.

SetEditFlag	Procedure SetEditFlag(AFlag: Word; Enable: Boolean);

                Sets the EditFlags for the radio buttons. No edit flags apply
                to radio buttons.

SetID           Procedure SetID(AFieldID: Word);

                Sets ID to AFieldID.

SetState	Procedure SetState(AState: Word; Enable: Boolean); Virtual;

                Calls the inherited SetState, then, if AState contains
                sfDisabled, calls the LLabel^.SetState with the value
                sfDisabled and the Enable parameter.

Store           Procedure Store(var S: TStream);
UnLock          Procedure UnLock;

                Unlocks the field and label by clearing the sfDisabled bit in
                the State flag.

                Calls the inherited Init then set sets Min and Max. AMask
                defines a picture that controls what characters may be
                entered.  AMask can contain literal characters as well as
                number digit place holders. Two characters can be used for
                indicating digits, '#' and '9'. The '9' allows the entry of
                digits 0 through 9, while the '#' also allows entry of a
                minus sign. If a decimal point (as defined in the DecimalPt
                constant) appears in the edit mask, the user may enter a
                decimal point in the number.

TbxRunDialog (TDialog)                                          TvDialog
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxRunDialog is the base object used to create several type
                of progress display dialogs. TbxRunDialogs do some work,
                while allowing the user to press a Cancel button to abort
                processing. TbxRunDialog is the parent of the
                TbxPercentDialog and TbxPrintDialog objects.

                To use a TbxRunDialog you must provide a Process method. The
                Process method is where all work be done.
                TbxRunDialog.Execute will repeatedly call your Process
                method, until there is nothing left to do. Your Process
                method needs to do the work in small bits, so that Execute
                can run and check for user input. When all the work is done,
                Process sets the RunState flag to cmJobComplete and Execute
                terminates. If RunState is ever set to cmCancelJob, which
                means the user aborted, your Process method must close down
                whatever it is doing so that Execute can terminate safely.

Fields 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Msg             Msg : PStaticText;

                Static text message displayed in first row of the dialog.

RunState	RunState : Word;

                Current state of the processing.

pfFlags         pfFlags : Word;

SButton         SButton : PButton;
CButton         CButton : PButton;

                Pointers to the dialog box buttons. The buttons change
                depending on the current state of the dialog box.

Methods 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Init            Constructor Init(var Bounds: TRect; ATitle: TTitleStr;
                                 AMessage: String; AOptions: Word;
                                 ButtonRow: Byte);

                ATitle is the dialog box title. You can choose several
                different combinations of buttons for the dialog. If AOptions
                equals mfCancel, only a cancel button will be added. If it
                equals mfCancel and mfOk, start and cancel buttons will be
                added. If AOptions includes mfPause, the dialog will also
                have pause capabilities. ButtonRow is the dialog box row
                where all buttons will be inserted.

                You can display a changeable message for the user by
                including mfMessageLine in AOptions. After the dialog is
                initialized, call ChangeMessage to display or change the
                message line. AMessage is the initial message to display,
                messages can only be displayed if AOptions includes
                mfMessageLine.

Load            Constructor Load(var S: TStream);
ChangeMessage	Procedure ChangeMessage(AMessage: String);

                Change the message displayed in the first row of the dialog
                box. This method has no effect if mfMessageLine was not
                included in the AOptions parameter passed to Init.

Execute         Function Execute: Word; Virtual;

                Execute consists of a loop that calls the Process method you
                have defined. At the bottom of the loop, RunState is checked
                to see if execution should continue.

                Repeat
                  GetEvent(Event);
                  HandleEvent(Event);
                  Process;
                Until (RunState > cmContinueJob);

HandleEvent	Procedure HandleEvent(var Event: TEvent); Virtual;

                Handles switching states of the dialog as buttons are
                pressed. Whenever a button is pressed HandleEvent sets the
                RunState field to the command of the pressed button.

Process         Procedure Process; Virtual;

                You MUST ALWAYS override this method. In Process you will
                include code to do the work. It must be able to do the work
                in small chunks, so the dialog box can occasionally get
                control back and check for user input. When processing is
                done, set the RunState field to cmJobComplete.

                Here is what a typical Process method might look like:

                Case RunState of
                  cmStartJob : {DO SETUP}
                    ....     Do setup and set RunState to cmContinueJob.
                  cmContinueJob : {DO NEXT TASK}
                    ....     This might be a short loop, that does the work
                             in steps. If there is nothing left to do set
                             RunState to cmJobComplete.
                  cmPauseJob : {DO NOTHING}
                    ....
                  cmCancelJob : {SHUT DOWN, USER ABORTED}
                    ....

TbxScrollDialog (TDialog)                                       TvScroll
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxScrollDialog provides a scrolling dialog box for large
                data entry forms. It contains a TGroup that provides the
                clipping region needed for a scrolling interior. A
                TbxScrollDialog can have vertical and horizontal scroll bars.

                If it has the gfScrollXY bit set in its GrowMode field, any
                view (TInputLines, TCheckBoxes, TStaticText, etc.) inserted
                into a TbxScrollDialog can be scrolled. The dialog can be
                scrolled with the scroll bars. It can also scroll as needed,
                on Tab and mouse presses, to keep the focused subview in full
                view.

                To insert scrolling views into a TbxScrollDialog use
                InsertToScroll instead of the standard Insert call.
                InsertToScroll will set the gfScrollXY bit set in the
                GrowMode field of the view.

                You must also call SetLimit, to control the size of the
                scrolling interior.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                TbxScrollWindow is a window that is intended to have subviews
                such as TInputLines inserted into it. It could be used to
                create spreadsheet views, or form layout views. If a view has
                the gfScrollXY bit set in its GrowMode field, it can be
                scrolled in a TbxScrollWindow. The window can be scrolled
                with the scroll bars, or can scroll as needed, on Tab and
                mouse presses, to keep the focused subview in full view.

                To insert scrolling views into a TbxScrollWindow, use
                InsertToScroll instead of the standard Insert call.
                InsertToScroll will set the gfScrollXY bit in the GrowMode
                field of the view.

                TbxTextWindow is a window that contains an instance of
                TTerminal for instant text display capabilities. If you need
                a quick text display window, but don't want the bother of
                defining a Draw method, just slap one of these into the
                desktop. Call the Write method with any strings you want to
                display.

                Alternately, you can create a cmDisplayStr broadcast event
                with a string pointer in the InfoPtr field. The string will
                be displayed in any open TbxTextWindow on the desktop.

TbxVListBox (TListBox)                                          TvDialog
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                Note : In the following descriptions the generic term FILE is
                used in reference to any sort of large ordered list of
                records that is too large to fit into memory. The actual list
                may or may not be stored in a disk file. It is recommended
                that you thoroughly understand the use of the normal list box
                and its collection before trying to use the TbxVListBox.

                A normal list box can only display collections of up to 16K
                items, and are not very good for large databases.
                TbxVListBoxes can display FILES of any size. Virtual list
                boxes allow complete freedom of movement in the FILE. Virtual
                list boxes work by storing only a small portion of the FILE
                in memory. To create a virtual list box, you must derive a
                new object from TbxVListBox that is able to move through and
                fetch items from the FILE.

                In the derived list box you MUST override GetItem, you will
                probably override MatchItem, and you may override the
                PageSize method. GetItem provides page by page movement
                through a FILE. TbxVListBox will not function unless you
                supply a GetItem method that works with your specific data.
                MatchItem searches for a particular item in a FILE. PageSize
                sets the size of the virtual paging through the FILE.

                In addition to overriding GetItem, you must do the original
                fill of the list box collection. This first fill will set the
                maximum collection size, so put an optimum number of items in
                it. After the list box has been initialized, create a new
                collection for the list box, fill it from the FILE, and call
                NewList to add the collection to the list box. Once you have
                setup the initial list box collection, TbxVListBox will
                handle the rest.

                One drawback to virtual list boxes is that the vertical
                scroll bar does not indicate a relative position in the FILE.
                The scroll bars only indicate the position in the current
                data stored in memory. However; there are flags that indicate
                when the top or bottom of the FILE has been reached.

Fields 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
AtMin           AtMin : Boolean;

                At the top of the FILE? This flag can be examined to see if
                movement before the start of the current list in memory is
                possible.

AtMax           AtMax : Boolean;

                At the bottom of the FILE? This flag can be examined to see
                if movement past the end of the current list in memory is
                possible.

Init            Constructor Init(Bounds: TRect; ANumCols: Word;
                                 AHScrollBar: PScrollBar;
                                 AVScrollBar: PScrollBar);

                This is the same interface as the standard Init. After
                calling the inherited Init, it sets AtMin and AtMax to
                False. Also calls SetComandState to disable the cmPrevPage,
                cmNextPage, cmFirstPage, and cmLastPage global commands.

                After the list box is initialized, you must fill it.
                Create and fill a collection with data, then call
                NewList to add it to the list box. You should set the
                collection size to some optimum value, as the initial size is
                the largest the list will ever be. You should also set the
                AtMax and AtMin flags.

                After the list box is filled initially, TbxVListBox will
                handle any subsquent changes.

Load            Constructor Load(var S: TStream);
FillByPage	Function FillByPage(Forward : Boolean): Integer; Virtual;

                Adds a new page of items to the top or bottom of the list
                box. FillByPage is called whenever a cmPrevPage or cmNextPage
                command is received by HandleEvent. New items are appended
                after the last item in the list box, if Forward is True. If
                Forward is False, items are inserted in front of the first
                item in the list box. In other words; items are added from
                the top up, or the bottom down. As each new item is inserted,
                one existing item is deleted from the opposite end of the
                list box.

                FillByPage calls GetItem to retrieve each item from the FILE.
                It inserts items into the list box until GetItem returns nil
                or PageSize items have been inserted. If fewer than PageSize
                items are added, either the AtMin or AtMax flag will be set
                to True, depending on the direction of the fill. FillByPage
                returns the number of items inserted into the list.

FillFrom        Function FillFrom(FromTop : Boolean): Integer; Virtual;

                Fills the list box from the top or bottom of the FILE.
                FillFrom is called by HandleEvent whenever a cmLastPage or
                cmFirstPage command is received. In other words, FillFrom is
                called to move to the top or bottom of the FILE. The FromTop
                parameter specifies the start position and direction of the
                fill. If FromTop is True, the list box is filled downward
                from the top of the FILE. If it is False, the list box is
                filled upward from the bottom of the FILE. Before any new
                items are inserted, all existing items are deleted from list
                box by calling List^.FreeAll.

                FillFrom calls GetItem to retrieve each item from the FILE.
                It inserts items into the list box until GetItem returns nil
                or List^.Limit is reached. If fewer than PageSize items are
                added, either the AtMin or AtMax flag will be set to True,
                depending on the direction of the fill. FillFrom returns the
                number of items inserted into the list.

FocusItem	Procedure FocusItem(Item : Integer); Virtual;

                Calls the inherited FocusItem then redraws the list box.

GetItem         Function GetItem(ACommand : Word): PObject; Virtual;

                You MUST override GetItem in all your derived objects. This
                method reads the FILE and returns a pointer to the next item
                that will be inserted into the list box. The list box will
                not function without this method.

                GetItem first establishes a new position in the FILE. The new
                FILE position is indicated by ACommand. ACommand will be a
                value such as vlNext or vlPrev, which mean move to the next
                or previous item in the FILE. The current FILE position just
                established must be preserved between calls to GetItem.

                If the correct file position can be established, GetItem
                returns a pointer to the new item. The pointer is to an
                object of the same type as in the list box collection, so
                that it can be inserted into the list box collection. If
                ACommand cannot be executed, say vlNext while already at the
                end of the FILE, then a nil pointer is returned.

                The following commands may be passed to GetItem :

                Command         Meaning
                vlMin           Move to first item in file, return a pointer
                                to it.
                vlMax           Move to last item in file, return a pointer
                                to it.
                vlCurrent       Return a pointer to the current item in the
                                file.
                vlNext          Advance to the next item in the file, return
                                a pointer to it.
                vlPrev          Move to the previous item in the file, return
                                a pointer to it.
                vlListMax       Move to the item in the file that matches the
                                first item in the list box, and return a
                                pointer to it.
                vlListMin       Move to the item in the file that matches the
                                last item in the list box, and return a
                                pointer to it.

HandleEvent     Procedure HandleEvent(var Event : TEvent); Virtual;

                Handles cmPrevPage, cmNextPage, cmFirstPage, and cmLastPage
                commands for list movement. These commands are global and may
                be generated by your program. One way to allow paging through
                an entire FILE would be to create a dialog box with Page Up,
                Page Down, Go To First Record, and Go To Last Record buttons.
                The commands cmPrevPage, cmNextPage, cmFirstPage, and
                cmLastPage are enabled and disabled by the collection fill
                methods according to the state of the AtMin and AtMax flags.

Lookup          Function Lookup(P : PObject): Boolean; Virtual;

                LookUp provides a means for searching the FILE for a
                specified item and displaying the results. LookUp calls
                MatchItem to do the searching. The P parameter is a pointer
                to the object to you want to search for. P is the same object
                type as returned by GetItem and as in the list box
                collection.

                LookUp, returns True if the item pointed by P is found. If P
                is found, LookUp refills the list box starting from the
                matching item, focuses the first item, and redraws the list
                box.

MatchItem	Function MatchItem(P : PObject): Boolean; Virtual;

                MatchItem searches the entire FILE (not just that portion
                stored in memory), to find a match for the item pointed to by
                P. P is the same object type as in the list box collection
                and the same type returned by the GetItem method.

                If a match is found, MatchItem must set the current position
                in the FILE to the position of the matching item. MatchItem
                returns True if a match is found and False otherwise. The
                default MatchItem method always returns False.

                When no match is found, MatchItem may set up a closest match.
                In that case it would always return True and MatchItem would
                set the current position in the FILE to the closest matching
                item.

NewList         Procedure NewList(AList: PCollection); Virtual;

                Inserts the collection pointed to by AList into the list box.
                Sets the enabled state of the cmNextPage, cmLastPage,
                cmPrevPage, and cmFirstPage global commands.

PageSize	Function PageSize : Integer; Virtual;

                This method returns the virtual page size for movement in the
                list. The default value returned is List^.Limit DIV 3. You
                may want to override to allow a large page size when stepping
                through the file.

SetCommandState Procedure SetCommandState(Enable : Boolean);

                Set the state of the cmNextPage, cmLastPage, cmPrevPage, and
                cmFirstPage global commands according to the values of AtMin,
                AtMax, and the Enable parameter.

Tbx3DToolBar (Tbx3DDialog)                                      Tv3D
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
                The Tbx3DToolBar implements a 3D tool/button bar using
                Tbx3DToolButtons. Tool bars are really just modeless dialogs
                that can't be selected or closed. The default tool bar has no
                frame and cannot be moved, this can be changed by overriding
                the InitFrame method.

                Tool bars can be vertical or horizontal and grow as needed to
                hold more buttons. The starting bounds of a tool bar specify
                only the upper left corner. Buttons are added to the tool bar
                by calling AddTool, passing the button title and command id.

                Tool bars respond only to mouse presses. Tool bars by
                themselves do no processing. When a button on the tool bar is
                pressed the associated command is broadcast throughout the
                application. Your application's HandleEvent method must be
                changed to receive these broadcast messages and implement any
                desired behavior.

                Tool bars are inserted directly into the desktop and MUST BE
                THE FIRST OBJECT INSERTED INTO THE DESKTOP! It is probably
                best to create a new InitDesktop method for your application
                and create a tool bar immediately after calling the inherited
                InitDesktop method.
