TextVu is a faster replacement for TextView. They don't work quite in
the same way, as explained below. You are free to use the code any way
you see fit, but I would appreciate bug reports and general comments.

TextVu was developped with TP6 using the BP7 TextView source, and tested
with TP6 and TP7, so it should work with both TP6 and T/BP7 (right?).

TFastTerminal is slightly different from TTerminal since it stores the
length of each line instead of using trailing line feeds. This means
that you could write a function such as

  function TFastTerminal.GetLine(Line:word):string;
  begin
    GetLine:=PString(Buffer^[NextLines(QueBack, Line-1)])^;
  end;

to retrieve a line of text from the buffer. I also removed the cursor as
I didn't like it, and there is no blank line at the bottom.

TextVu inherits a lot of junk from TTerminal, so you still need the old
unit. All the methods included in TextVu are faster and smarter
replacements of the TTerminal ones. The unit uses slightly less memory
and redraw speed is twice as fast (really zippy). There is no longint
arithmetic and no PrevLines any more, but NextLines is so much faster.
Remember that you need the old TextView...

For a demonstration, compile the accompanying DEMO.PAS (from TP6,
the original TVTXTDMO.PAS except it uses TFastTerminal instead) and type
"DEMO textvu.pas".

I am considering enhancing it further, maybe another interface than the
AssignCrt way? Does any one really use TTerminal? If you do, write me.

Have Fun!
